# We might want to keep the directory structure but not the files
# or just ignore the whole outputs folder if it's purely generated.
# For now, I'll ignore the generated files but keep the folders if .gitkeep exists
# (I'll need to create .gitkeep if I want that, but for now specific ignore is safer)
